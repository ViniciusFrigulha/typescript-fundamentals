# TypeScript Fundamentals

This repository documents my journey learning and strengthening TypeScript fundamentals, with a focus on understanding the language from the ground up.

The goal is not to rely on frameworks or shortcuts, but to build a solid foundation that will support future backend and full-stack projects.

## 📌 Purpose

- Practice TypeScript fundamentals in a structured way
- Understand typing, functions, objects, and advanced concepts
- Build consistency through small, incremental exercises
- Create a public learning log focused on fundamentals

- `02-typing` → interfaces, type aliases, enums  
- `03-objects` → object typing, readonly, optional properties  
- `04-advanced` → generics, unions, intersections, utility types
